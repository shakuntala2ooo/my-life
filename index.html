                        <h2>Bhagavad Gita Krishna,Arjun and Vedvyas</h2>
                        <p>The Bhagavad Gita, as well as the epic Mahabharata of which it is a part, is attributed to the sage Vyasa, whose full name was Krishna Dvaipayana, also called Veda-Vyasa. Bhagavad Gita is the conversation between SriKrishna and
                            Arjuna in the Kurukshetra battle field.Krishna responds by teaching Arjuna how to see, not from his own particular point of view, but from the point of view of “Time,” in which everyone is born and lives and finally passes
                            away.

                        </h2>
                        <p>Krishna asks Arjun to unite his consciousness with God in true Yog, to surrender himself into the Lord. Here Krishna wants to say to overcome the duality, infatuation to the illusory world of the senses and as illusion of worldly
                            love and attachment, and to surrender the eternal truth.</p>

                        </h2>
                        <p>During 13 years of exile in the forest, when Yudhisthir went to the well for water and to see why his brothers are not coming, Yaksha asked him 60 questions. One of these questions was: kim āśhcharyaṁ? “What is the most surprising
                            thing in this world?” Yudhisthir replied: "ahany ahani bhūtāni gachchhantīha yamālayam śheṣhāḥ sthiratvam ichchhanti kimāśhcharyamataḥ param (Mahabharat) [v30] ". “At every moment people are dying. Those who are alive are witnessing
                            this phenomenon, and yet they do not think that one day they will also have to die. What can be more astonishing than this?” Shree Krishna explains in this verse that life is inescapably a dead end, and so a wise person does
                            not lament over the inevitable. The Battle field of Kurukshetra, being the will of the Supreme, was an inevitable event,and to fight for the right cause is the duty of Ksatriya(Brahmin, Ksatriya, Vaishya, Shudra are not by
                            Born, but by Karma.)
